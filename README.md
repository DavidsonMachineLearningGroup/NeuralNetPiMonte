# NeuralNetPiMonte
Neural Network That Helps Calculate Pi
- trains a neural network to model the pythagorean theorem using google's tensorflow machine learning toolkit
- uses a uniform random number generation during the training process above
- as such, able to leverage monte carlo technique to calculate pi wrt a unit circle

End results:
- calculates pi concurrently with the training of the pythagorean theorem model

Coolness factors:
- pythagorean theorem is only modeled and is continuously changing
- the neural net is responsible for most (though not all) of the Pi calculation
- happy Pi day, this is for March 14, 2017
